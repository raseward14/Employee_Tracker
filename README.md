## Description
An interface that serves as a Content Management System for managing a company's employees using node, inquirer, and MySQL.

This built in command-line application allows the user to add departments, roles, and employees, view departments, roles, and employees, and update employee roles. Click the link below for a video walkthrough.

To control the order the code executes, async & await functions are utilized. The user navigates a list inquirer prompt, sending a response into a switch statemtent that calls one of several asynchronous functions below, each of which has at least one SQL query that returns, deletes, or updates data from the database.
